### **When & Why to Use It**

1. **When you want the AI to explore different ideas before deciding**
   → Like brainstorming multiple paths and choosing the smartest one.
2. **When the task feels complicated or has many possible outcomes**
   → The AI thinks in branches, compares them, and selects the best.
3. **When you want a polished final answer that considers alternatives**
   → It avoids “one-track thinking” and produces a well-rounded response.

### **When & Why to Use It**

1. **When you want the AI to follow a specific style or format**

2. **When you need consistency across multiple outputs**

   → Useful for sensitive messages, updates, corrections, or clarifications.
