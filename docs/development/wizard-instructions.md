Generate instructions for adding a new framework card named Discover. The Discover card will be used to create a wizard-like form that guides a user through selecting the appropriate framework based on the task the user would like to accomplish and the framework's purpose, as outlined in 'frameworks-selection.md'. Assume the user is non-technical and has no understanding of what a prompting framework is. The end goal would be for the wizard to select the prompting framework, navigate to the appropriate framework form, and populate the framework's form template for the user based on the information elicited from the user. The user should be informed why the framework was selected, so that it becomes a learning experience. 


Before generating the code describe the steps that you will take to complete the task. Be sure to consider the following:
- Code generated is consistent with the styling and coding structure 
- Tests are created to validate the functionality and behavior
- Best practices are observed
- Security practices are observed
- The user experience is paramount in code and layout construction
- Make recommendations that may improve the UX.
